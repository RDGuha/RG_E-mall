### Description

RG E-mall is created as a part of the NIIT's Digital Transformation course. This is one of the two sub-project of RG E-mall Ecommerce project. It contains the BackEnd Part ie. Java model classes, DAOs and their Implementations. I have used JUnit TestCase to test the functionality of this project and it is integrated with the frontEnd Project.
